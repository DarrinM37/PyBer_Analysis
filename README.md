The multiline graph and DataFrame summary(The above visualizations) shows several key findings:

* Suburban cities have about 6 times more drives than rural. 

* Rural drivers have a higer average per fare per rider and driver.


### Summary:

The Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher than suburban and urban cities. This can indicate that rural based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. This can result in a majority of drivers being occupied with current trips and create a potential loss of revenue when there are peaks in business.
